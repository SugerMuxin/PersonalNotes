>Every day, in all kinds of weather , thousands of men and women go jogging. Why has jogging - running slowly for long distances -- become so popular ? Most joggers like it because they have heard it is a very good exercise. Jogging makes the heart stronger and helps people lose weight. It can also help them feel better about themselves.

>How fast should you go ? Jog with a friend and talk to each other as you run . If you have difficulty talking , you are going too fast. How far should you jog? Remember not to go too far too soon. In fact you should walk ,  not run , the first few times. Then do some short jogs , but no more than what you can do cmfortably.

>After that, increase your distance a quarter or half of a mile every two weeks or so. Maybe in a few years , you , too , can run in a marathon like thousands of other people do.
