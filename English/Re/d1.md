   but the joy of harvesting makes you forget all the pains and troubles you have gone through. So an old proverb says that the sweetest fruit is one that has undergone the bitterest ordeal.

>There are servel keys to sucess.First ,your goal must be pratical and particable . If you set your goal too high,chances are that you will never attain it.Next , you have to make a plan of doing it. You can take some steps to realize it . Since  the process is quite tough , you need to be diligent , patient and <span style="color:yellow;">persevering</span>.
