>As food is to the body, so is learning to the mind. Our body grow and muscles devolop with the intake of food. Likewise , we should keep learning day by day to maintain our mental power and expand our intellectual capcity.

>Constant learning supplies us with fuel for driving us to sharpen our power of reasoning , analysis , and judgement. Continuous learning is the best way to keep pace with the times in the information age.

>It is a common misunderstanding to regard school as the only place for the acquisition of knowledge . On the contrary , learning should be an endless process , from the cradle to the grave . With the world changing so fast , to stop learning for just a few days will make a person lag behind.

>Lack of learning will inevitably lead to the stagnation of the mind, or even worse, its fossilization . Therefore, to stay mentally young , we have to take learning as a lifecareer.
